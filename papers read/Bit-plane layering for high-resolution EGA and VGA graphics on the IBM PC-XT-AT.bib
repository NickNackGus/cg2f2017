abstract="Each page of video memory comprises four parallel planes that can be manipulated and displayed independently or in combination. A technique is described that involves programming the video hardware to achieve this. The utility of well-known video programming technology, such as the tachistoscope display, is thereby extended. Assembly language code is included, and a demonstration program is described.",
